### How it works

I use the minmax algorithm to determine the best move for the AI. The algorithm looks at all possible actions and selects the action which would result in the best score if the user played optimally.

### Issues I ran across
I struggled with figuring out the best way to implement the algorithm. The next steps would be to implement a minmax with alpha-beta pruning to optimize the algorithm.
